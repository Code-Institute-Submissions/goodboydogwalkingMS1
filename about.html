                                <p>My name is Arina and I am originally from Hertfordshire but took the leap to move  to Buckingham a year ago. This was the start of my new adventure and business, I have loved every minute of living in this beautiful area, and I consider myself very lucky to be able to do the job I do!
                                Previously, before becoming a dog walker, I worked in a Kennels. This taught me the handling of different dogs and I met so many fantastic breeds whilst working here. It really allowed 
                                me to find my passion in dogs and dog care. I then went onto work for a dog walker and loved every minute of it. I believe walks for dogs are such a great way to train and develop your dog, no matter
                                the age! Walks are a brilliant way to allow socialisation to happen in a neutral enrivonment. Equally I understand that not every dog enjoys socialising with others, so I know perfect quiet routes
                                to allow for stress free walks for the dog. Throughout my walks, I work with positive reinforcement, using tit-bits to help. This is of course discussed with the owners, if dog has any allergies 
                                or owners would prefer their dog to not have any. I understand that the dogs are part of your family and I will always treat your dog as if he/she was my own. </p>

                        <p> A little bit more about me. I have always loved animals. Growing up I had a cat called Fuzzle and a Chihuahua called Lulah, they were my pride and joy and are what started my obsession with animals! I then went onto start riding horses. After a few years I took the plunge and decided to buy my first horse, Nellie. She taught me so much about patience and caring for a scared animal. She will always have a place in my heart. I now own a New Forest Pony called Daz. He is very special and likes to keep me on my toes! A few months ago myself and my partner decided to rescue a Husky Cross from abroad. She has been amazing!
                        Once again has taught me a lot of different lessons. All of these animals have had a huge part to play in my animal development and knowledge. Ontop of this I have done many courses, including Doggy 
                        First Aid. </p>
