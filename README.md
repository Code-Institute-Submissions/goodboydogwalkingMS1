## UX
![Image of Responsive Sites](assets/images/responsive.jpg)
* This website is being created for a milestone project, I have come across bugs and slight errors which I have continued to work through. I am aiming to get a page done a day. I have been rewatching and listening to the lessons in this unit, I have also been looking over previous projects. For my user, I have maintained a clear and precise website structure. I would like my user to be able to perform actions to enable them to see the availability of the service.

## Design
### Color Scheme
![Image of Color Scheme](assets/images/colorscheme.jpg)
This consists of BEB29B and the palet DFD7CB/DFD4C0. I used [ColorSchemeDesigner](https://colorschemedesigner.com/csd-3.5/) to allow me to see this palet.
* BEB29B used for the Header and Footer
* DFD7CB used for the background
* Font color all in black
* Roboto Condensed throughout the website
### Wireframe
This wireframe was created on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) during my planning and designing process. 
I found [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) easy to use and very helpful to adjust my design if needed.
The main wireframe can be seen on this link [here]((https://www.figma.com/file/d0o10f4rwLb0JekvXAIbib/goodboy?node-id=0%3A1).
