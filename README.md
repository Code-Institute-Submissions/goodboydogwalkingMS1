<h1>Good Boy Dog Walking Pet Service</h1>

<h3>Explaination</h3>
<p>This is a website explaining a service offered for pets and livestock, in a certain area. The website is layed out over four pages. There is a fifth page which was added in as a request to showcase pieces of art commisioned. I have used a simple design to layout information clealy and presicely.</p>

<h3>UX</h3>
<p>This website is being created for a milestone project, I have come across bugs and slight errors which I have continued to work through. I am aiming to get a page done a day. I have been rewatching and listening to the lessons in this unit, I have also been looking over previous projects. For my user, I have maintained a clear and precise website structure. I would like my user to be able to perform actions to enable them to see the availability of the service.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<p>Feature 1 allows users to learn about the service provider, giving a back history. This service is a close and personal one, who learning about the provider will allow security.</p>
<p>Feature 2 allows users to see all services offered with a clearly laid out price list.</p>
<p>Feature 3 is a form allowing possible clients to ask questions, leaving their email will allow service provider to get back to them.</p>
<p>Feature 4 allows users to see a clearly laid out page to see styles of art work and commissions which have been done previously.</p>
<p>A possible feature to think about is a gallery, possibly interactive. This will allow users to get a clearer idea of the service being provided.</p>
